# What is this?
I got accepted into MS in Artificial Intelligence & Innovation at Carnegie Mellon University on 8th of Feb 2020. I saw this as an opportunity to grow and to change things in the world using the power of AI. I also wanted to document my journey through university, having found that reflecting on one's journey can be quite useful in the future. So this is the implementation of my own interactive journal.
# Why is this Repo named 10601
 10601 is CMU's Introduction to Machine Learning Course. Here is a new kind of interactive blog that i wanted to make regarding me auditing this course, but, i ended up creating a whole blog about my life at CMU, thus came the fated name to the repo, 10601 and ironically, this would also represent a course which i never took as i managed to get a waiver due to already knowing enough machine learning.
