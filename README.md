# What is this?
I got accepted into MS in Artificial Intelligence & Innovation at Carnegie Mellon University on 8th of Feb 2020. I saw this as an opportunity to grow and to change things in the world using the power of AI. I also wanted to document my jounrey through university, having found that reflecting on one's journey can be quite useful in the future.
